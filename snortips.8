.Dt SNORTIPS 8
.Sh NAME
.Nm snortips
.Nd turns
.Xr snort 8
into an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar conffile
.Op Fl a Ar alertfile
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl V
.Op Fl p Ar pidfile
.Op Fl s Ar seconds
.Op Fl m Ar seconds
.Op Fl d Ar dumpfile
.Op Fl u Ar sigmsgfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon parses
.Xr snort 8 Ns 's
alertfile (syslog) and blocks
the naughty hosts for a specific amount of time using pfctl.
It also handles alertfile rotation.
By default it inserts hosts in the
.Nm
table.
.Pp
You need these lines in your
.Xr pf.conf 5 :
.D1 table < Ns Nm Ns >
.D1 "block in" log quick from < Ns Nm Ns >
.Pp
.Nm
is able to recover previously blocked hosts when starting.
It will assign them the default block duration.
.Pp
.Nm
relies completely on pfctl output, and corrects its behavior
and hosts tables accordingly.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy -f Ar conffile
The location of configuration file. This file contains settings such as
block durations, priority and keywords to match in alert logs,
and white and black lists. Lists may contain CIDR subnets.
Configuration is reloaded from this file upon SIGHUP.
.It Sy -a Ar alertfile
The location of
.Xr snort 8 Ns 's
alertfile.
It must be syslog alert format.
(/var/log/snort/alert.log)
.It Sy -h
Show usage and exit
.It Sy -V
Show version and exit
.It Sy -p Ar pidfile
The location of
.Nm Ns 's
pidfile.  (/var/run/snortips.pid)
.It Sy -s Ar seconds
How long the naughty hosts should be blocked. (60 seconds)
.It Sy -m Ar seconds
Maximum block duration, after which duration is not extended. (3600 seconds)
.It Sy -d Ar dumpfile
The location of dumpfile. Upon receiving INFO signal,
.Nm
dumps currently blocked, whitelisted, and blacklisted hosts with total
number of each to this dumpfile.
.It Sy -u Ar sigmsgfile
The location of sigmsg file. This file is used to give commands to
.Nm ,
one command per line. Commands may be for blocking (B) and unblocking (U)
hosts. If it's a blocking command you can provide expiration time in
seconds to use instead of the default value.

For example,
.Pp
.D1 B 192.168.1.1 600
.D1 U 10.0.0.0/24
.Pp
First command blocks the host 192.168.1.1 for 10 minutes (600 seconds), while
the second unblocks the 10.0.0.0/24 network.

For these commands to be processed
.Nm
should be signaled with USR1. After processing, sigmsgfile is deleted.
.El
.Sh SIGNALS
.Nm
handles following signals:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy SIGTERM, SIGINT
Terminate reporting current blocked hosts.
.It Sy SIGHUP
Reload configuration.
.It Sy SIGINFO
Dump current lists to dumpfile: blocked, white, and black lists.
.It Sy SIGUSR1
Read sigmsgfile and process the commands in it.
.It Sy SIGUSR2
Soft init: unblock all non-blacklisted hosts and zero all variables.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
# /usr/local/sbin/snortips -s 180
.Pp
Blocks naughty hosts for 3 minutes (180 seconds).
.Sh BUGS AND KNOWN PROBLEMS
SnortIPS will only work with IPv4, not IPv6.
